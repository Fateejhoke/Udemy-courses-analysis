# Udemy-courses-analysis
## INTRODUCTION
This is a Power BI project that gives analysis on a wide range of courses categorized into four (4) subject areas on Udemy from July 2011 to July 2017. Udemy is an online educational platform founded in 2010. It is a platform with instructors from different countries that allows individuals around the world to learn and develop skills on their preferred topics. The goal of this project is to gain insight into how people use the learning platform six years after it was created. The skills demonstrated in this project include:

•	Data cleaning 

•	Critical Thinking

•	Problem solving

•	Data visualization.
## OBJECTIVES
•	To identify the number of courses that are paid and free.

•	To identify the subscribers across each level and courses available.

•	Track of monthly subjects.

•	Evaluation of the courses.
## DATA SOURCING
The dataset was obtained as a workbook consisting of four worksheets in an Excel file. I imported the data into Power BI, cleaned the data, performed analysis to answer the problem stated, and created visualizations for it.
## ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
I made the simple graphic choice to reflect the brand's purple color. Regardless of anyone's degree of knowledge, I attempted to make it simple to understand. I added filters to the dashboard so that the user could personalize the data and generated a number of visualizations to indicate the quantity of courses, overall subscribers, subjects, and subscribers by level.
The dashboard consists of these visuals;

i.	COURSES WITH THE MOST SUBSCRIBER

The table shows the courses in all the subjects, price, price option, and rating. With this, anybody can know whether their course of interest is paid or free and know the course evaluation. It can also be filtered from the top right to identify the subject area and more desired questions.

Here is the dashboard i came up with;

## FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION
•	This analysis revealed that most of the courses are paid, and more resources should be allocated for free courses or discounted for people who are not financially capable of enhancing their skills.

•	In the first half of the year, Udemy published a vast collection of courses in all subject areas.
				
•	Compare to other level of expertise, beginner level has the highest number of subscribers which means the courses are beginner-friendly.

•	Half of the subscribers actually enrolled in the subject areas, a support system should be developed to help learners achieve their goals and build on their accomplishment.

•	The majority of the subscribers registered for courses in web development.

•	Udemy offers the highest courses in web development, with the lowest in musical instruments.
